That's a great and honest question, Hadeel 🌟 — and you’re already doing the right thing by starting with a real project! Since you're a beginner and working on your **"Real-Time News Summarizer and Quiz Maker"** project, here’s a personalized learning path for **exactly what you need to learn (and nothing extra)**.

## 🧭 Beginner Learning Roadmap (For Your Project)

### 💡 Goal: Build the project + Understand ML, DL, NLP, LLM basics

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Python Essentials** (Week 1)

🔸 Learn how to:

* Write functions and use variables
* Read/write files
* Use modules (`import requests`, `import json`)
* Use virtual environments & `pip` to install packages

🛠️ Tools:

* VS Code
* Google Colab (optional for trying code snippets)

📘 Learn:

* [Python for Beginners (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* [freeCodeCamp Python crash course](https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw)

---

### ✅ **Phase 2: APIs + News Fetching** (Week 1–2)

🔸 Learn:

* What are APIs?
* How to use `requests.get()` in Python
* How to parse JSON
* How to use **NewsAPI** or **GNews API**

📘 Learn:

* [Real Python: Working with APIs](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/)

---

### ✅ **Phase 3: NLP Basics** (Week 2–3)

🔸 Learn:

* What is NLP?
* Tokenization, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* How to use `spaCy` for extracting keywords
* How to install and use `en_core_web_sm`

📘 Learn:

* [spaCy 101 (Official)](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101)
* [freeCodeCamp NLP Crash Course](https://youtu.be/xvqsFTUsOmc)

---

### ✅ **Phase 4: Summarization Using LLMs (Week 3–4)**

🔸 Learn:

* What is text summarization (Extractive vs Abstractive)
* What is a Transformer model (T5, BART)
* How to use `transformers` library and `pipeline("summarization")`

📘 Learn:

* [HuggingFace Transformers Beginner Guide](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
* Use Google Colab to try:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
summarizer("Your long news article here...")
```

---

### ✅ **Phase 5: Quiz Generation** (Week 4)

🔸 Learn:

* How to identify important words using NER
* How to replace those words with blanks
* Create MCQs or fill-in-the-blank style questions

📘 Practice:

* Build your own simple quiz logic
* Example: Replace "Narendra Modi" with "\_\_\_\_\_"

---

### ✅ **Phase 6: Connect All Modules** (Week 5)

🔸 Learn:

* How to organize Python files (`main.py`, `fetch_news.py`, etc.)
* How to call one function from another file
* How to store output in files (JSON or text)

📘 Practice:

* Combine API → Summarization → Quiz generation into one Python script

---

## 📝 What You Don’t Need to Learn *Right Now*

🚫 Training ML models from scratch
🚫 Advanced stats and math
🚫 Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch (yet)
🚫 Full web development

---

## 📄 Optional Project Add-ons (Later)

If you finish early or want extra features:

* Add topic filters (e.g., only Technology news)
* Add a real/fake news detector (ML)
* Export quizzes to a file
* Build a small web interface (later)

---

## 📦 I Can Give You:

✅ Pre-made Python code templates
✅ A printable weekly checklist
✅ A basic quiz generator ready to test
✅ A sample `.ipynb` notebook to explore code

Would you like me to send the **first week checklist** to help you get started and track your learning?
